A credit card approval system with 5 ml models
Credit cards are a popular risk management strategy in the financial sector. To estimate the 
likelihood of future defaults and credit card borrowing, it uses the personal information and 
data provided by credit card applicants. The bank has the authority to choose whether to give 
the applicant a credit card. The degree of risk can be objectively measured by credit scores. The 
dataset consists of two csv files: application record.csv contains applicant information such as 
income, children, and home ownership, among other things. Credit records for several clients 
are contained in the credit record.csv file.
We would be developing machine learning algorithms, more predictive methods such as 
Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines etc. can been used for credit card 
scoring after cleaning the data and performing the EDA.
Our main objective is to predict if the applicant is good or bad using the machine learning 
algorithms and the dataset. We could then see the acceptance and the rejection percentage of 
the applicants.
